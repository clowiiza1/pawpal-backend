# Summary
PawPal is a full-stack web application that streamlines the adoption and volunteer management process for animal shelters. The platform allows users to browse all available cats and dogs, with advanced filtering based on traits to help them find their perfect companion. Volunteers can register or log in to book adoption viewings, schedule volunteering dates, and manage their profiles. Staff and administrators benefit from a dedicated dashboard for managing animals, users, bookings, and traits through full CRUD functionality, as well as generating real-time reports on current and past adoptions. PawPal bridges the gap between shelters, adopters, and volunteers, creating an efficient, user-friendly ecosystem for animal care and adoption.

Our First Full-Stack Web Application, was devloped using React.js, Tailwind.css, Spring boot Java, MySQL, and AWS services such as AWS Amplify, S3, and EC2. The backend code (Spring boot Java) can be found under this repository, while the repository (pawpal) contains the front end code (React.js, Tailwind.css etc.) which was connected to AWS Amplify.
