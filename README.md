Our First Full-Stack Web Application, was devloped using React.js, Tailwind.css, Spring boot Java, MySQL, and AWS services such as AWS Amplify, S3, and EC2. This repository (pawpal) contains the front end code (React.js, Tailwind.css etc.) which was connected to AWS Amplify. The backend code (Spring boot Java) can be found under the pawpal-backend repository.
